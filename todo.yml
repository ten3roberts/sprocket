Graphics:
    - Material
    - Proper renderer
    - 
Systems:
    - Desc: 
      Introduce systems that run asynchronously on different threads
      Entities are defined by several components that have the same entity
      Each system has its own entities
      When a change is made, it is sent across a channel as an event to the application, which then relays it to each  other system that subscribed for that event
    - Renderer:
      Stores mesh, material, and uniform data
      Relies on Subsystems to update the uniform data for each entity

    - Physics:
      Does all physics calculations
      Sends changed entities via a channel to the application that then relays it to the renderer which updates the position
